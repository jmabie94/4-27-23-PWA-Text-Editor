### User Story
```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```
## Installation:

Utilizing the Application is simple!

Option A - Use the Heroku Deployment directly by way of https://fast-lake-90185.herokuapp.com/.

Option B - Clone the repo:
    
    git clone git@github.com:jmabie94/4-27-23-PWA-Text-Editor.git

Next, open an integrated terminal in your cloned folder and do the following:
    
    run "npm init -y"
    run "npm i"

After Node Packages have installed, open run the application:

    run "npm run start"


Finally, open your browser to http://localhost:3000/ and freely edit the text or install the application!
